# MTC-direct-fire-calc
direct fire arty calc for multi tank crew combat on Roblox 
note that this caulculator DOES NOT acount for height difrence and assumes that both you and the target are both level

You can do what ever you want with the code or what ever just make sure to credit me :)

If your trying to make a calculator for MTC the gravity value is 17.81 m/s (This information was pretty much no where and I had to calculate it manually)
